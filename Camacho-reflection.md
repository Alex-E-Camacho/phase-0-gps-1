**Release 7: Reflect**

*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*

I was having difficulty wrapping my head around merging branches in the Git workflow. I was afraid of merging incorrectly and losing progress. This wouldn't be a big deal with these small text files but I would hate for that to happen with the more complest assignments in future weeks. 

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*
 
 I had never really seen the <fetch> command before and when I googled it, did not find much answers. Because of being under pressure, I somehow Googled it correctly and realized <fetch> and <merge> were really the <pull> command separated. 

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*

I asked my guide about the <-b> flag. My pair and I were unsure if the <-b> flag created a new branch or just the <checkout> flag did. She clarified that the -b just took us to the new branch but that the <checkout> flag is what created the new one.

 *What still confuses you about Git?*

 I'm am still trying to get comfortable with knowing when to add a file to the staging area. I have to figure out if a file is already included in a previous commit or if branching means that the files have to be re-added. 

 *How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?* 

I was extremely nervous and was actually shaking in the first ten minutes. There was a sense of urgency I created in my head because suddenlly two people were depending on what I learned (or didn't learn). However, our guide stopped us and explained how to be the navigator/driver correctly and it all made more sense. Instead of me thinking I had two people to let down, I suddenly felt like I had two people to depend on. It was more reassuring and all of the studying that I had done before came more fluidly and we did well (in my opinion). I'm definitely not fearing the next GPS but rather looking forward to it.
