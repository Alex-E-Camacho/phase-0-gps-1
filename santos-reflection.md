What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Working from branches, and push/pull from github

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Git workflow, push/pull requests with another person, merge conflicts and actually seeing one.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I first asked my pair partner about any commands I was unsure about, and asked my GPS questions in regard to being more efficient as a driver/navigator.

What still confuses you about Git?
I'm still not very confident on working on branches. I understand the concept and how to use, but I feel like I still need to practice so that I don't miss steps when going from local to remote and vice versa

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Overall, it was a very good and much-needed experience. My partner and I were both very nervous in the beginning, probably just because we didn't know exactly what to expect. Fortunately, our GPS was very patient and relatable. My pair partner was also very calm and collected. I really enjoyed the feeling of having extra sets of eyes for better perspectives, especially at points where I felt unsure.
